Oh no, here I'm really 
<br/>
ashamed to say
<br/>
I haven't yet!
<br/>
Even though I live in Israel!
<br/>
That's what happens
<br/>
when it's in your own country!
<br/>
You never get to it
<br/>
because you are too busy
<br/>
with your regular life
<br/>
and think you can always get there...
<br/>
some time!
<br/>
So for now I'm still forced
<br/>
to refer to others
</p>

Yes, that's in Israel
<br/>
So this time I have to
<br/>
say it to myself:
<br/>
Create a chance and
<br/>
go for it!

</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:#FD1C03">
But at least for now, I can see it by them
<br/>
or on our site!!!
